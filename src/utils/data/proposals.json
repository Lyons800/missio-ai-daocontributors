        "body": "Proposal Category: Process\n\nAbstract: Adding the abstain option, in addition to “In Favor” and “Against” allows voters and delegates to participate in voting without having to take a side.\n\nMotivation: Adding abstain to voting allows users to vote on every proposal regardless of how they feel about the proposal. This would also allow ApeCoin DAO delegates to maintain a high voter participation rate.\n\nRationale: Many delegates and voters will simply not vote if they wish to vote against a proposal. This weakens the data for # of voters and # of votes and makes our DAO look less active than it really is.\n\nSpecifications: Add Abstain to Snapshot. Abstentions do not affect the outcome of the vote.\n\nSteps to Implement: The relevant parties responsible for Discourse and Snapshot will add the Abstain option to all future proposals in addition to “In Favor” and “Against”.\n\nTimeline: As soon as administratively possible\n\nOverall Cost: There is no overall cost to the DAO.",
